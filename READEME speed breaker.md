SPEED BREAKER WARNING SYSTEM

This is a IOT based project that is based to detect the speed breaker using sensor and warning the driver. In this project using ARDUINO UNO with Lidar and Ultrasonic Sensor for to detect the speed breaker to avoid accidents. 

Steps to use:

1.	Microcontroller Setup: Connect your microcontroller to the computer and set it up.
2.	Sensor Connection: Connect the ultrasonic sensor or other chosen sensors to the microcontroller.
3.	Buzzer Connection: Connect the buzzer to a digital pin on the microcontroller.
4.	Install IDE: Install the development environment for your microcontroller (e.g., Arduino IDE for Arduino boards).
5.	Write the Code: Upload the source cod for an Arduino-based system using an Lidar sensor.
